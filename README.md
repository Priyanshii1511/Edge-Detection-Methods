An edge can be defined as a set of connected pixels that forms a boundary between two disjoint regions.<\br>
##Edge Detection
Edge Detection is a method of segmenting an image into regions of discontinuity. Edge Detection techniques are useful for Image Processing like Pattern Recognition and Feature Extraction. </br></br>
Various Edge Detection Operators have been implemented using a sample image:
1. Sobel Operator
2. Prewitt Operator
3. Robert Operator
4. Canny Edge Detector 
5. Laplacian of Gaussian
6. Active Contour
